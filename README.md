# Casp1Aldh1l1-scRNAseq
R code and relevant files used for the analysis of hippocampal scRNAseq data from Casp1(fl/fl) Aldh1l1-CreERT2(+/-) mice and littermate controls.

The raw data from the sequencing run are too large to upload here and will be posted elsewhere. These files are necessary to run the code from the very beginning and include the barcodes, features, and matrix gz files stored in the following folder names: ctrl_raw_feature_bc_matrix, tx_raw_feature_bc_matrix. Instead, the "merged_seurat.Rdata" file compiling these features is included here to run the code from line 87 onward.
